# Bikesharing
This project uses Tableau to visualize data for a bike sharing starter in Des Moines.
## Overview: Using data based on a bikesharing company called CitiBikes in New York City, we formulated a capable visualization to present to possible stakeholders. The goal of the visualization was to show the promise that a similar company could have in a city like Des Moines.

## The link above provides access to our Tableau Story. 
### Our analysis suggest that the bikes offer a great source of environment friendly transportation within urban areas. A BikeSharing company provides quick, convenient, and easily accessible transportation for people of all backgrounds. However, in our analysis, there is one demographic attribute that can predict a return customer and subscriber. Males are overwhelmingly the mass of the users using CitiBike services. Our current data does not provide insight for why males make up our majority gender population. 
### As noted above, males make up the bulk of the 2,344,244 CitiBike users; there are about 1.5 million males to be exact. Of those 2.3 million overall customers, there are 1.9 million subscribers vs. the 440,000 casual customers. These results offer us some insight as to who these services should initially be promoted towards. Eventually, a shift in advertisement and innovations can be aimed towards female and undeclared genders.
### Lastly, there is an average bike rental time of about 10 minutes. This was listed in our data as “Tripduration.” Each bike had a recorded trip in seconds which offered insight on how often a bike would be “on-route” to their next destination. We later interpreted this as a rental period that is independent of the destination. This informs us that each bike, on average, should provide at least 4 – 5 rides per hour. This estimate takes into consideration a rough margin of error, so it is to be taken loosely. Overall, the NYC CitiBike starter was a great investment but how does this translate over to Des Moines…

## Conclusion:
### The CitiBikes bike-sharing programs works very well in New York City. Our visualization was able to show the promise behind a program like this within the bounds of a very large and dense city. We were also able to identify our target audience and perhaps a payment method/ subscription type (i.e., monthly or annual subscriptions).
## Concerns:
### Our data is great for highlighting the potential for a starter company like this being deployed in another city like New York City, however, we cannot guarantee the same results for Des Moines with only the data provided. We highly recommend another analysis that considers the demographic data from the city of Des Moines, which could identify the population breakdown by several factors, the types of jobs, and city hot spots that could provide some insight on whether this type of business could “ride on.” We especially suggest identifying the size of the male workforce in the inner city, popular sites, restaurants, and areas of high car congestions. At the least, the city’s gender breakdown and the number of hotspots based on foot traffic.
